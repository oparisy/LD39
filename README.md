# Power Tycoon

My Ludum Dare 39 Jam entry, "Power Tycoon" ([entry page](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&uid=50996)).

Theme: "Running out of time".

The submitted version is published at [oparisy.github.io/LD39](http://oparisy.github.io/LD39/).

## Tech

Coded in TypeScript, based on the three.js library.

Based on the [three-typescript-starter](https://github.com/pinqy520/three-typescript-starter) starter project.

### Launching from source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/oparisy/LD39.git
cd LD39
npm install
npm start
```

### Packaging

```shell
npm run build
```

This will create a "docs" folder (as per github conventions) containing the distributable game.
