# Power Tycoon

My Ludum Dare 39 (2-days) Jam entry, "Power Tycoon" ([entry page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/power-tycoon)).

Theme: "Running out of Power".

The submitted version is published at [oparisy.github.io/LD39](http://oparisy.github.io/LD39/).

## Tech

Coded in TypeScript, based on the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library.

Starter project: [three-typescript-starter](https://github.com/pinqy520/three-typescript-starter).

### Launching from source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/oparisy/LD39.git
cd LD39
npm install
npm start
```

### Packaging

```shell
npm run build
```

This will create a "docs" folder (as per github conventions) containing the distributable game.
